## 🚗 What is Open Coupé Lab

**Open Coupé Lab** is a project created to build an open-source laboratory dedicated to developing **electronic and digital tools for the Fiat Coupé and other classic vehicles**.  
The lab will serve as the foundation for designing **dashboards, sensor modules, loggers, and embedded systems**, combining electronics, software, and 3D printing.

The association will be **non-profit**: every contribution will be used exclusively to establish and equip the laboratory, where all members will collaborate on open projects.
