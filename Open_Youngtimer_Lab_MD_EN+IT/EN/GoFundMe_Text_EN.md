## 🚗 What is Open Youngtimer Lab

**Open Youngtimer Lab** is an open-source project created to establish a collaborative laboratory dedicated to developing **electronic and digital tools for youngtimer vehicles**, roughly from 1985 to 2000.  

Based in **Capriate San Gervasio (BG)**, Italy, the lab will bring together enthusiasts, engineers, and makers to design **digital dashboards, sensor modules, data loggers, diagnostic interfaces, and 3D-printed components**.

The association is **non-profit**: every contribution is used solely to found and equip the laboratory where members can work and learn together.
